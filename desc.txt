?? Library Management System – Python Script DescriptionThis Python program is a command-line-based Library Management System that allows users to manage books, library members, and their transactions (like checking out and returning books). The system uses JSON files to store persistent data for books, members, and transactions.?? Core Functionalities1. Data Storageo Uses three JSON files:* books.json: Stores all book records.* members.json: Stores registered library members.* transactions.json: Stores checkout and return records.2. Featureso Add Book: Allows entry of a new book with title, author, and ISBN.o List Books: Displays all books with availability status.o Add Member: Registers a new member with a unique ID.o List Members: Displays all members and how many books they have borrowed.o Checkout Book: Assigns an available book to a selected member, updates records.o Return Book: Returns a borrowed book to the library and updates availability.o Exit: Safely exits the program.3. Data Integrityo Prevents duplicate ISBNs and member IDs.o Updates all related files after each transaction.o Handles invalid user input gracefully with try-except blocks.??? Technical Highlights* Uses functions to modularize code for clarity and reuse.* Implements file handling with JSON for persistent storage.* Tracks time-stamped transactions using Python’s datetime.* Designed to be run in terminal/command-line environments.
